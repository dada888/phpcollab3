====== phpCollab3 Documentation ======

**** IMPORTANT: *****************

One of the files that you will download is named "patch.diff". It contains the modification to do to sfDoctrinePlugin to get PHPCollab3 work!!
This operation is needed because symfonty 1.2 and doctrine 1.0 have problems using equal nested relations.

The problem should be fixed in symfony 1.3 (using doctrine 1.1). PHPCollab will migrate to the next release of symfony as soon as it is enough stable
